1. Palindrome
   - Given a string, you have to predict whether it can be changed into a palindrome or not by changing the positions of the characters.
2. FizzBuzz
   - Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to n on a new line.
   - For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
   - For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
   - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
